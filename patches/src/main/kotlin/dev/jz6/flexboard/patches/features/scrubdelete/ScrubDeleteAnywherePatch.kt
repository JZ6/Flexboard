/**
 * Gboard already implements swipe-to-delete-a-word. `ScrubDeleteMotionEventHandler` is the swipe
 * on the backspace key, and everything it does — progressive delete, drag back to restore,
 * distance thresholds, tracking across the full keyboard width — lives in a shared
 * `ScrubMotionEventHandler` that is entirely key-agnostic once a gesture has begun.
 *
 * The only thing scoping it to backspace is one comparison in `g(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;)V`:
 *
 * ```
 * iget   v5, v5, Loud;->c:I     # keycode of the key under the finger
 * iget   v6, v1, Lpbv;->a:I     # the configured start keycode, 67 for delete
 * if-ne  v5, v6, -> bail
 * ```
 *
 * So this patch does not implement a gesture. It widens where Gboard's own gesture is allowed to
 * start, in two edits:
 *
 *  1. `ScrubDeleteMotionEventHandler.<init>` passes **-1** instead of `KEYCODE_DEL`.
 *  2. `g()` skips the comparison when the configured keycode is negative.
 *
 * A negative sentinel is what makes the second edit register-free: every Android keycode is
 * non-negative, so the test is `if-ltz` — format 21t, one register, no constant, and therefore no
 * need to prove some register is dead at that point in a 259-instruction method.
 *
 * The other two subclasses are untouched. `ScrubMoveMotionEventHandler` (spacebar cursor) and
 * `InlineSuggestionScrubSpaceMotionEventHandler` both pass 62, so their gate still enforces.
 *
 * See `docs/motion-event-handlers.md` for how all of this was derived.
